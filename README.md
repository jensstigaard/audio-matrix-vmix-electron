## Downloads

See the [**Releases**](../../releases) tab for a direct download of the app for Windows or Mac.

## Features
### Intuitive interface
Clean and intuitive interface with the primarily use case for toggling audiobusses on/off for inputs

### vMix host entering
In the app bar you can easily change the vMix host or IP address.
It includes a dropdown menu with recently used hosts, so you can easily swap between hosts.

### Audio controls
Simple audio controls for volume and mute/unmute for
* audio busses A-G
* inputs with audio

Use the shortcut `Cmd+Alt+A` (or the action in the app menu) to toggle visibility of the audio controls.
In some cases it is convenient that the interface is as simple as possible, and only with the audio matrix, without many disturbing controls.

### Hide inputs without audio
Use the shortcut `Cmd+Alt+I` (or the action in the app menu) to toggle visibility of vMix inputs without audio channels.
This enables even simpler interface in case needed.

### Custom bus labels
Give each audio bus a custom label name to enable more convenience in controlling the audio busses and inputs of your production.

### Fixed header
The fixed header ensures faster operation even with many inputs in the vMix setup.

## Additional features
Do you have a good idea for an additional feature for this app? Post a [new Issue](../../issues/new) or write me an email at <jens@stigaard.info>.

## Known issues
 - Inputs without audio channels will appear in the interface, but any action will be ignored, since the input has no audio (Found by Dave Edwards - Thanks for the tip - It is a problem with the vMix API itself, and it is reported to vMix)
