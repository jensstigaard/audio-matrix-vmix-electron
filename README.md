## Downloads

See the [**Releases**](../../releases) tab for a direct download of the app for Windows or Mac.

## Features
### Intuitive interface
Clean and intuitive interface with the primarily use case for toggling audiobusses on/off for inputs

### vMix host entering
In the app bar you can easily change the vMix host or IP address.
It includes a dropdown menu with recently used hosts, so you can easily swap between hosts.

### Audio controls
Simply audio controls for audio busses A-G including volume control and mute/unmute.
You can also use the button in the app bar to toggle show/hide of the audio controls in case you want the interface as simple as possible, and only with the audio matrix.

## Additional featuers
Do you have a good idea for an additional feature for this app? Post an Issue or write me an email @ <jens@stigaard.info>.

## Known issues
 - Inputs without audio channels will appear in the interface, but any action will be ignored, since the input has no audio (Found by Dave Edwards - Thanks for the tip - It is a problem with the vMix API itself, and it is reported to vMix)
